# Ch. 2: How Knowledge Builds on Knowledge

## Hook
Imagine a child stacking wooden blocks. Math is the first block: counting and simple shapes. Physics balances on top, explaining why the tower falls. Engineering adds reinforcements and bridges. Computing arrives when the child draws a blueprint and simulates the build before touching the blocks.

In another story, a farmer learns to measure rainfall, then studies soil chemistry, then designs a small irrigation controller with off-the-shelf electronics. Each step leans on the prior one. Knowledge is a relay, not a collection of silos.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Disciplines form a dependency graph-understanding how ideas stack lets you learn faster and recombine fields deliberately.

## Why this matters
When you know which ideas feed others, you can choose efficient learning paths and spot missing prerequisites. It also shows you where to borrow tools: linear algebra drives graphics; thermodynamics informs data-center cooling; linguistics shapes programming languages.

## Concept
Math gives you abstract structures; physics applies them to matter and energy; engineering turns laws into repeatable devices; computing automates patterns and scales logic. Higher-level fields (economics, biology, design) reuse these tools in new contexts. Thinking in chains helps you navigate from "I don't get this" to "I need to backfill that prerequisite" instead of feeling stuck.

## Activity
Pick a technology you use daily (GPS, streaming video, bike gears). Map the prerequisite ideas back five steps. Example for GPS: satellites -> orbital mechanics -> Newtonian physics -> calculus -> measurement and geometry. Identify the weakest link in your own understanding and spend 20 minutes reading or watching a primer on it.
