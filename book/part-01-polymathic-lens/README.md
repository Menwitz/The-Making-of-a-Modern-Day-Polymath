# Part I: The Polymathic Lens

Perspective precedes content. These chapters explain why polymathy matters, how knowledge stacks, and how wisdom guides action. We set the spine for the whole book: sciences emerged from human needs, each one fed the next, and weaving them together helps you understand the world and live better. You will practice switching lenses on purpose-seeing the same problem as a mathematician, an engineer, and a philosopher.

## Activity for this part
Pick a familiar object (a mug, a bicycle, a tree). Describe it in three ways: its measurable properties, its uses, and its meaning to you. Notice how each description opens a different path to understanding and improvement.

## Reflection
- Where did two lenses give you opposite answers? What does that tension reveal?
- Which lens felt most natural? Which lens felt foreign but useful?
