# Part I: The Polymathic Lens

Perspective precedes content. These chapters explain why polymathy matters, how knowledge stacks, and how wisdom guides action. You will practice switching lenses on purpose-seeing the same problem as a mathematician, an engineer, and a philosopher.

## Activity for this part
