# Ch. 1: Why Polymathy?

## Hook
A city loses power during a heatwave. An electrical engineer leads repairs until she hits a grid-control software glitch. A neighbor who runs a local theater steps in-he once coded lighting rigs and understands stagecraft logistics. Together they improvise a manual schedule that keeps hospitals powered and food cold. Two disciplines, one solution.

Another moment: a doctor who paints landscapes notices a patient's odd skin tone the way she spots mismatched hues on canvas. That observation triggers tests that catch a rare disease early. Her creative eye augments her clinical training.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Polymathy turns diverse lenses into a single problem-solving toolkit that makes you more creative and resilient than specialization alone.

## Why this matters
The world rarely hands you problems with labels that match your major. You need multiple models-physical, social, ethical-to avoid brittle answers and to spot opportunities others miss.

## Concept
Specialization narrows search space; polymathy expands it. When you can ask "What would a biologist notice? What would an engineer prototype? What would a storyteller reframe?" you surface options faster and avoid blind spots. Polymathy is not shallow dabbling; it is depth in a few areas plus fluency in many, stitched together by curiosity.

## Activity
Pick a nagging problem you have (sleep, budgeting, team conflict). Write three answers to "How might I solve this?"-one as a scientist (measure, experiment), one as a designer (observe users, sketch), one as a coach (habit and feedback). Choose one action from each answer and try them this week.
