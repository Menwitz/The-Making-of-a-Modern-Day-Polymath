# Ch. 3: Wisdom Beyond Knowledge

## Hook
A research lab cracks a powerful gene-editing method. Excitement surges-until someone asks, "Should we release this?" The room shifts from biology to ethics, from "can" to "should." The decision shapes generations.

Or think of an engineer who can build a flawless recommendation engine. Without wisdom, it might amplify harm; with wisdom, it becomes a tool for discovery and care. Knowing how to do something is different from knowing why and when.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Wisdom is the governing layer that directs knowledge and skill toward humane ends.

## Why this matters
Polymathy without judgment is cleverness without compass. Ethics, philosophy, and history help you see second-order effects and choose actions that align with your values and community.

## Concept
Wisdom asks: What is the purpose? Who is affected? What happens next? It integrates context (history), principles (ethics), and consequences (systems thinking). A polymath gathers perspectives but lets wisdom pick the path. This keeps curiosity constructive and guards against unintended harm.

## Activity
Take a recent decision you made at work or home. Write a short postmortem: What did you optimize for? Who benefitted? Who paid a cost? How would a historian, an ethicist, and a systems engineer critique your choice? Note one change you would make next time.
