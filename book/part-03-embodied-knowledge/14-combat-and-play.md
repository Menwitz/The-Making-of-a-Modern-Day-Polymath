# Ch. 14: Combat and Play

## Hook
Two boxers spar lightly. One slips a punch by a hair and counters with calm precision. In that instant, timing, pattern recognition, and emotional control converge.

Another table: friends play chess. A player senses a trap because the board "feels" unbalanced. Strategy games and martial arts both sharpen decisions under uncertainty.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Combat sports and strategy games train pattern recognition, timing, and composure when stakes and pressure rise.

## Why this matters
Life delivers conflicts-negotiations, crises, surprises. Practicing under controlled stress builds the ability to stay curious, adapt, and act with intention rather than panic.

## Concept
Martial arts teach distance, leverage, and respect. Boxing refines timing and defense. Strategy games like chess teach planning, trade-offs, and probabilistic thinking. The common core: act, observe feedback, update your model quickly.

## Activity
Play a five-minute chess game and note three moments you misread the board. Then shadowbox or air-spar for two minutes, focusing only on footwork and breathing. Write one line about how your attention shifted in each practice.
