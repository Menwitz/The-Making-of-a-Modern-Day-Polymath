# Ch. 13: Fire and Flesh

## Hook
You light a campfire and cook a simple meal. You watch raw meat firm up, vegetables caramelize, and wood turn to embers. Chemistry and survival meet in the flame.

Another scene: a hunter in the field treats food with reverence because they saw the entire chain-tracking, ethical shot, field dressing, cooking. Survival skills reconnect you to energy sources and cycles.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Working with fire, food, and survival basics reveals how energy transforms matter and sustains life.

## Why this matters
Cooking teaches reaction control; hunting and foraging teach ecology and ethics; basic survival builds confidence and respect for resources. These skills ground you in the material realities behind modern convenience.

## Concept
Culinary chemistry covers heat transfer, Maillard reactions, and emulsions. Foraging demands pattern recognition and risk assessment. Hunting and butchery involve anatomy and safety. Survival weaves them together with shelter, water, and fire-making.

## Activity
Cook the same ingredient three ways (roast, steam, sear). Note texture, flavor, and moisture differences. Write one paragraph on how heat method changed the chemistry. Optionally, practice a friction fire with supervision or a ferro rod to feel energy transfer firsthand.
