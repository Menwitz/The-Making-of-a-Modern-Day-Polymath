# Ch. 13: Fire and Flesh

## Hook
You light a campfire and cook a simple meal. You watch raw meat firm up, vegetables caramelize, and wood turn to embers. Chemistry and survival meet in the flame.

Another scene: a hunter in the field treats food with reverence because they saw the entire chain-tracking, ethical shot, field dressing, cooking. Survival skills reconnect you to energy sources and cycles.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Working with fire, food, and survival basics reveals how energy transforms matter and sustains life.

## Why this matters
Cooking teaches reaction control; hunting and foraging teach ecology and ethics; basic survival builds confidence and respect for resources. These skills ground you in the material realities behind modern convenience.

## Concept
Culinary chemistry covers heat transfer, Maillard reactions, and emulsions. Foraging demands pattern recognition and risk assessment. Hunting and butchery involve anatomy and safety. Survival weaves them together with shelter, water, and fire-making.

## Feel the science
- Chemistry: phase change, denaturation, reactions.
- Thermodynamics: heat transfer and energy budgets.
- Ecology/ethics: resource cycles, sustainability, and respect for impact.

### Quick map (need -> invention -> next field)
- Preserve and prepare food -> controlled heat and cooking methods -> culinary science and nutrition.
- Survive outdoors -> fire-making and shelter basics -> energy management and safety.
- Respect ecosystems -> foraging and ethical hunting -> sustainable resource use and stewardship.

### Optional mini-visual
Draw three heat methods (roast, steam, sear) as inputs leading to a plate. Note how each changes moisture, texture, and flavor for the same ingredient.

## Activity
Cook the same ingredient three ways (roast, steam, sear). Note texture, flavor, and moisture differences. Write one paragraph on how heat method changed the chemistry. Optionally, practice a friction fire with supervision or a ferro rod to feel energy transfer firsthand.

## Reflection
- What transformation do you depend on daily without noticing its inputs and waste?
- How does seeing the full chain (source -> preparation -> use -> discard) change your choices?
