# Ch. 16: Air and Sky

## Hook
A child flies a kite and feels the tug when the wind shifts. Years later, a student pilot senses lift on final approach and adjusts instinctively. Air teaches subtlety.

Another vignette: a skydiver exits a plane, stabilizes in freefall, then navigates a canopy to a precise landing spot. Mastery comes from reading air and trusting checklists.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Aviation and aerial sports train you to read invisible forces, manage risk with procedure, and act calmly in three-dimensional space.

## Why this matters
Flight compresses feedback loops; mistakes can be costly. Learning to follow checklists, respect weather, and practice emergency procedures builds disciplined thinking transferable to any high-stakes project.

## Concept
Aerodynamics explains lift and drag; gliding and powered flight add energy management; skydiving adds body control in airflow. Safety culture-briefings, checklists, redundancy-is as core as physics.

## Activity
Fold and test three paper airplane designs. Measure glide distance and stability. Write down how small design changes (wing dihedral, nose weight) alter performance. Connect those changes to lift, drag, and center of gravity.
