# Ch. 15: Machines and Craft

## Hook
A teenager fixes a bicycle derailleur and suddenly understands torque and alignment. A watchmaker assembles gears by hand, feeling tolerances you cannot see. Building by hand teaches physics through fingertips.

Another scene: an amateur tinkers with a microcontroller, wiring LEDs to blink. The circuit comes alive, and abstraction collapses into tangible cause and effect.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Hands-on making turns mechanical and electrical principles into intuition you can trust.

## Why this matters
When you can diagnose a squeaking hinge, a misaligned wheel, or a flaky circuit, you are less dependent on black boxes. Craft builds confidence and respect for the built world.

## Concept
Mechanics covers forces, levers, and gear ratios. Electronics introduces voltage, current, and logic. Prototyping blends both with iterative design. Craft is the habit of building, testing, and refining in the physical world.

## Feel the science
- Mechanics: torque, friction, tolerances.
- Electronics: voltage, current, resistance, and simple logic.
- Design: iteration, constraints, and trade-offs.

### Quick map (need -> invention -> next field)
- Fixing daily tools -> mechanics basics -> engineering intuition and diagnostics.
- Automating small tasks -> simple circuits and microcontrollers -> prototypes and products.
- Reducing guesswork -> build-test-refine loops -> design judgment you can trust.

### Optional mini-visual
Draw an exploded sketch of a simple device (bike brake, flashlight). Label where force travels or where electrons flow. Circle one point most likely to fail and test it.

## Activity
Disassemble a small broken device (old mouse, toy). Identify each component and guess its role. Reassemble or repurpose parts into something simple (LED on battery with switch). Note what you learned about design choices and constraints.

## Reflection
- Which failure mode taught you the most? What did it reveal about the system?
- How could you prototype a life decision the way you prototype hardware?
