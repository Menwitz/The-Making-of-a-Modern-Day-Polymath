# Ch. 11: Mastery of Movement

## Hook
A dancer practices a pirouette until her body knows balance better than her mind can explain. An athlete learns to feel force angles through a sprint start. Movement is physics made tangible.

Another scene: a climber on an indoor wall shifts weight subtly and suddenly the route unlocks. The lesson is not just strength but proprioception-an internal map of space and force.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Training movement turns your body into a sensor and calculator, giving you real-time intuition about balance, force, and flow.

## Why this matters
Embodied skills deepen cognitive models. When you feel torque, momentum, and timing, abstract physics becomes lived experience, improving everything from posture at a laptop to how you teach others.

## Concept
Athletics, yoga, and dance each refine control, flexibility, and rhythm. They teach alignment (how force travels through joints), timing (when to apply effort), and recovery (how systems restore). Movement practice is iterative modeling with your own body as the test bed.

## Activity
Film yourself performing a simple move (air squat, sun salutation, basic dance step). Watch in slow motion. Note joint angles and balance shifts. Make one adjustment and refilm. Observe how feedback tightens your internal model.
