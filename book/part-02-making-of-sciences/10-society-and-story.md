# Ch. 10: Society and Story

## Hook
A clay tablet records a grain trade; a storyteller sings a victory; a scribe drafts a law. Language and narrative bind groups together, enabling history, economics, and politics. Without stories and records, society frays.

Another scene: a modern economist reads shipping data, a linguist tracks meme evolution, and a historian compares them to past panics. Together they predict a supply shock before it hits. Story and data intertwine.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Societies run on shared stories, rules, and incentives-studying language, history, and economics reveals how human systems evolve and can be steered.

## Why this matters
Every technical system lives inside a social system. Understanding incentives, culture, and narrative helps you design products, policies, and messages that work in the real world.

## Concept
Language enables memory and coordination; literature transmits values; history shows patterns and consequences; economics models incentives and trade-offs; political science studies power and governance. Together they explain why groups act as they do and how change spreads.

## Origin and bridge
Need: coordinate groups and remember agreements. Invention: language, story, and record-keeping. Leap: formal models of incentives, power, and culture. Bridge: social sciences feed design, policy, and ethics-shaping how technical systems land in the real world.

### Quick map (need -> invention -> next field)
- Coordinate memory and trade -> language, writing, history -> law and governance.
- Align incentives -> economics and political science -> policy design and market design.
- Share meaning -> stories and rhetoric -> culture change and leadership.

## Activity
Pick a current policy debate. Summarize it twice: once as a story (characters, conflict, stakes) and once as an economics problem (agents, incentives, constraints). Compare what each summary highlights and omits. Note how that changes your view of viable solutions.

### Optional mini-visual
Draw two columns for the same issue: story frame (protagonists, conflict, stakes) and economics frame (agents, incentives, constraints). Add arrows showing how changing one element shifts the other column.

## Reflection
- Which incentive or story currently drives your team, community, or market?
- Where could a change in narrative unlock a better outcome?
