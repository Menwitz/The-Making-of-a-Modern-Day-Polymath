# Ch. 5: Nature's Laws

## Hook
A stone skips across a pond. Watching its arc leads to questions about force and motion. Centuries of curiosity-Archimedes with levers, Newton with falling apples, Einstein with speeding trains-stack into physics, a playbook for how the universe moves.

Another story: a teenager builds a homemade radio. She starts with geometry to wind coils, uses electromagnetism to tune frequencies, and relies on relativity for the GPS timestamp that sets the station clock. Physics quietly choreographs it all.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Physics translates mathematical structures into rules about matter, energy, and motion, giving us predictive control of the physical world.

## Why this matters
Whether you design bridges, circuits, rockets, or climate models, you lean on physics. It teaches you to ask "What forces act here? What energy flows?" before you build or blame.

## Concept
Start simple: geometry tracks shapes; classical mechanics explains motion; electromagnetism unifies electricity and magnetism; relativity refines motion at high speeds and gravity at cosmic scales; quantum mechanics governs the small. Physics evolves by testing ideas against experiments and refining models that survive.

## Activity
Pick a daily object (bike, fan, door). Sketch the forces when it moves or resists motion. Label where energy enters and where it dissipates. Then change one variable (add weight, adjust friction) and predict the new behavior before you test it. This trains intuition in cause and effect.
