# Ch. 8: Machines of Thought

## Hook
A merchant with an abacus speeds through sums. Centuries later, Ada Lovelace imagines a machine that can weave numbers like threads. Today, algorithms drive cars and translate languages. Computing is the craft of automating thought.

In another vignette, codebreakers during World War II crack ciphers by blending mathematics, logic, and engineering. Their work seeds modern cryptography and computer science.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Computer science turns logic into machinery-algorithms, data structures, and architectures-that automate reasoning at scale.

## Why this matters
Software mediates nearly every modern system. Understanding its foundations lets you judge what is possible, secure what you build, and question the limits of automation.

## Concept
Start with algorithms (step-by-step procedures) and data structures (how you organize information). Theory of computation asks what can be computed at all. Cryptography uses math to secure communication. Artificial intelligence builds models that learn patterns rather than follow fixed rules. Together, they form the toolkit for building and evaluating machines of thought.

## Origin and bridge
Need: automate calculation and communication. Invention: procedures (algorithms) and structures (data) that machines can execute. Leap: learning systems that infer patterns (AI). Bridge: computing scales every discipline-physics simulations, chemistry modeling, biology sequencing-and now feeds back into how we think about thinking.

## Activity
Implement a simple cipher by hand: write a message, shift each letter by three (Caesar cipher), and share it with a friend to decode. Then list one strength and one weakness of this scheme. You just explored the basics of algorithms and cryptography.

## Reflection
- Where do you already trust an algorithm with judgment (recommendations, navigation)? Why?
- What human process could you model as data + algorithm to improve it?
