# Part II: The Making of Sciences (The Intellectual Journey)

Humanity built sciences to answer the same recurring questions: What is out there? How does it move? How do we shape it? These chapters trace the ladder from counting stones to computing ideas, showing how each field stands on another's shoulders.

## Activity for this part
Draw a dependency chain from math to a technology you love (e.g., calculus -> electromagnetism -> electronics -> computers -> the web). Add one question at each link. You are mapping the relay race of ideas.
