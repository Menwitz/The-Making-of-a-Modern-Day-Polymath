# Ch. 6: Energy and Transformation

## Hook
A candle flame mesmerizes a child. Why does wax disappear and heat bloom? That curiosity leads to chemistry-the study of matter's swaps-and thermodynamics, the accounting ledger of energy.

Another scene: a blacksmith hammers red-hot metal. He is manipulating crystal structures without naming them, relying on centuries of material science encoded in craft. Modern materials labs now design alloys on computers before a single hammer falls.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Chemistry and thermodynamics explain how matter rearranges and how energy flows, letting us design transformations on purpose.

## Why this matters
Cooking, batteries, vaccines, engines, and climate models all depend on controlling reactions and energy budgets. Understanding these basics keeps you from treating transformations as magic.

## Concept
Chemistry starts with atoms and bonds, builds into reactions and kinetics, and merges with thermodynamics to track energy and entropy. Materials science applies these rules to create metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites with tuned properties. The theme: change requires accounting-what enters, what leaves, what is conserved.

## Origin and bridge
Need: control fire, preserve food, and craft stronger tools. Invention: rules for how matter rearranges and how energy flows. Leap: designing reactions, fuels, and materials on purpose. Bridge: chemistry and thermodynamics feed materials science, batteries, engines, and the systems engineers rely on.

### Quick map (need -> invention -> next field)
- Food and fire -> preservation, cooking, metallurgy -> materials science.
- Heat and work -> thermodynamics -> engines and power grids.
- Precision reactions -> chemistry -> batteries, fuels, and synthesis.

## Activity
Cook an egg two ways (boiled and fried). Note texture, time, and heat source. Write one paragraph about what happened to proteins and water in each method. You just performed a controlled experiment in phase change and denaturation.

### Optional mini-visual
Draw a three-box sketch: inputs (heat, reactants) -> transformation (bond breaking/forming, energy flow) -> outputs (texture, products, waste). Use your egg experiment as the concrete example.

## Reflection
- Where do you already rely on a transformation you cannot yet explain (e.g., fermentation, combustion, corrosion)?
- What energy budget do you manage daily (calories, electricity, fuel), and how could you measure it better?
