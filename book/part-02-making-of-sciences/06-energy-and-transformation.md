# Ch. 6: Energy and Transformation

## Hook
A candle flame mesmerizes a child. Why does wax disappear and heat bloom? That curiosity leads to chemistry-the study of matter's swaps-and thermodynamics, the accounting ledger of energy.

Another scene: a blacksmith hammers red-hot metal. He is manipulating crystal structures without naming them, relying on centuries of material science encoded in craft. Modern materials labs now design alloys on computers before a single hammer falls.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Chemistry and thermodynamics explain how matter rearranges and how energy flows, letting us design transformations on purpose.

## Why this matters
Cooking, batteries, vaccines, engines, and climate models all depend on controlling reactions and energy budgets. Understanding these basics keeps you from treating transformations as magic.

## Concept
Chemistry starts with atoms and bonds, builds into reactions and kinetics, and merges with thermodynamics to track energy and entropy. Materials science applies these rules to create metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites with tuned properties. The theme: change requires accounting-what enters, what leaves, what is conserved.

## Activity
Cook an egg two ways (boiled and fried). Note texture, time, and heat source. Write one paragraph about what happened to proteins and water in each method. You just performed a controlled experiment in phase change and denaturation.
