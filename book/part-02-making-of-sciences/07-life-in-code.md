# Ch. 7: Life in Code

## Hook
A scientist watches a single cell divide under a microscope. That split, guided by chemical signals and genetic scripts, builds entire organisms. Biology is matter with instructions.

Elsewhere, researchers decode the human genome and spot a mutation that explains a family illness. In the same week, a neuroscientist maps brain signals to predict movement. Life is patterns encoded, read, and executed.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Biology studies living systems as coded, interacting networks-from DNA to neurons-revealing how information drives life.

## Why this matters
Medicine, agriculture, and neuroscience rest on understanding how information and matter intertwine. Knowing the "code of life" lets you reason about health, adaptation, and even artificial systems modeled on biology.

## Concept
Start with cells and membranes, move to genetics (DNA, RNA, proteins), then to molecular biology (pathways, regulation). Systems biology views interactions as networks. Neuroscience adds electrochemical signaling and plasticity. Computational biology models all of the above to predict behavior and design interventions.

## Activity
Extract DNA from a strawberry (many home guides exist: salt, dish soap, alcohol). Observe the cloudy strands. Write a short note on how that physical goo encodes traits like flavor and color. Then sketch one feedback loop in your own body (e.g., hunger hormones) and label the signals.
