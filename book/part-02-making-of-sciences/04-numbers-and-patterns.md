# Ch. 4: Numbers and Patterns

## Hook
A child draws tally marks in the dirt to keep score. Those marks become numbers, and soon she notices patterns: every fifth mark makes a gate, tens stack neatly. Centuries later, a trader invents zero to simplify bookkeeping, and the same idea unlocks algebra and calculus.

In another vignette, an artist sketching tiles in Morocco sees repeating geometry. The shapes inspire questions about symmetry and groups-the same math that powers modern cryptography. Patterns travel farther than their creators ever imagine.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Mathematics starts with counting and grows into a language for spotting, describing, and predicting patterns everywhere.

## Why this matters
Math is the substrate of every quantitative field. Fluency in its patterns lets you translate messy reality into models you can test, optimize, or communicate. Without it, later sciences feel like memorizing spells.

## Concept
Start simple: counting and number systems let you label quantity. Arithmetic manipulates those labels; algebra abstracts them; calculus tracks change. Along the way, geometry and probability offer spatial and uncertainty lenses. Each layer refines your ability to compress reality into symbols and reason reliably.

## Activity
Take a daily routine (making coffee, commuting). Count something for a week: steps, grams, minutes. Plot the numbers on a simple graph. Ask: what pattern appears? Make one small change and see how the pattern shifts. You just ran an experiment with math as your lens.
