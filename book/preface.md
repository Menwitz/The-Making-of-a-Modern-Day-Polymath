# Preface: The Call to Polymathy

## Hook
Picture two friends stranded overnight in an airport: one is a civil engineer who also paints watercolors and once took a wilderness first-aid course; the other is a specialist in a single software library. When the terminal lights dim, the polymath designs a sleeping pod out of benches, sketches a signage hack to guide late arrivals, and calmly triages a sprained ankle. Their mix of perspectives turns a delay into a solvable design problem.

Another scene: a biotech founder and former jazz musician diagnoses a data bug because the pattern "feels off" the way a wrong chord does. She catches the error hours before launch, not by rote checklists but by sensing dissonance across domains. Polymathy is not trivia collection-it is a way of seeing.

## Thesis (one sentence)
A modern polymath is someone who gathers lenses from diverse fields and uses them to solve real problems with originality and resilience.

## Why this matters
Specialization powers progress, but brittle expertise snaps under novel stress. A polymathic toolkit-multiple ways to observe, model, build, and communicate-keeps you adaptive when the map no longer matches the territory.

## How to use this book
This book is a guided tour of perspectives. Each chapter mixes a quick story, a core idea, and a hands-on exercise. You are invited to toggle between learning and doing, so concepts become muscle memory.

## Activity
Choose three challenges in your life (a work project, a relationship knot, a personal habit). Write down how a scientist, an engineer, an artist, and an athlete would each approach it. Notice the different questions each lens asks. Keep this list; you will revisit it throughout the book.
