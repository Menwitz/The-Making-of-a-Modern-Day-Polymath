# Part IV: Synthesis

Here we fuse lenses, design learning systems, and imagine the future. Interdisciplinary thinking is a deliberate practice; you will build frameworks to combine ideas and plan a lifelong curriculum.

## Activity for this part
Take any current headline. Draft two explanations: one using a scientific lens (mechanisms, data, models) and one using a human lens (stories, incentives, ethics). Compare how each shapes the decisions you would make.

## Reflection
- Which lenses gave conflicting answers? How would you reconcile them?
- What is your repeatable method for integration (e.g., map problem -> list lenses -> choose tools -> run small experiment -> reflect)?
