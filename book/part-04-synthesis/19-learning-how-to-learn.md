# Ch. 19: Learning How to Learn

## Hook
A student rewrites notes by hand and forgets everything. She switches to spaced repetition and concept maps, and suddenly retention sticks. Another learner films themselves teaching a topic to an imaginary class; the gaps become obvious and fixable.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Learning is a skill: you can design systems-memory, practice, reflection-to acquire knowledge faster and keep it longer.

## Why this matters
Curiosity without method stalls. With good learning mechanics, you can pick up any discipline you need for your polymathic stack.

## Concept
Metacognition (thinking about how you think) guides strategy. Spaced repetition and active recall strengthen memory. Interleaving mixes topics to build flexibility. Deliberate practice targets weak points with feedback. Reflection consolidates lessons and improves the next cycle.

## Bridge
Learning mechanics are the glue for polymathy. They let you climb prerequisite chains faster and keep the bridges between fields intact instead of forgetting them.

### Quick map (need -> invention -> next field)
- Forgetting and overload -> spaced repetition and active recall -> durable knowledge across domains.
- Stalling on hard topics -> backfill prerequisites and interleaving -> faster comprehension.
- Plateaued skills -> deliberate practice with feedback -> transferable mastery loops.

### Optional mini-visual
Sketch a learning loop: plan -> practice/recall -> feedback -> reflection -> next plan. Mark where you will add one new tactic (spaced repetition, interleaving, or teaching).

## Activity
Choose one topic you want to learn. Create a 7-day plan: daily 25-minute sessions using active recall (flashcards or closed-book summaries), plus a short reflection each night on what stuck and what needs clarification. At the end, teach the topic in five minutes to a friend or camera.

## Reflection
- Which tactic moved from theory to habit this week?
- How will you tweak your learning loop for the next discipline you tackle?
