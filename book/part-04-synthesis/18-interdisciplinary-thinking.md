# Ch. 18: Interdisciplinary Thinking

## Hook
A bioengineer studies shark skin to design antibacterial hospital surfaces. A musician-turned-programmer invents a rhythm-based compression algorithm. Innovation often arrives when two fields collide.

Another scene: during a wildfire response, a team blends meteorology, logistics, sociology, and UX design to build an evacuation app that people actually trust and use. Integration beats depth alone.

## Thesis (one sentence)
Interdisciplinary thinking is the deliberate practice of combining lenses to generate better questions, models, and solutions.

## Why this matters
Complex problems-climate, healthcare, education, AI ethics-do not respect discipline boundaries. You need tools to mix methods without creating noise or gimmicks.

## Concept
Start with clear problem framing, then map relevant domains and their assumptions. Use translation tools (analogies, shared metrics, visuals) to align experts. Frameworks like a cross-pollination matrix (domain A methods applied to domain B problems) and problem-mapping ladder (data -> model -> intervention -> feedback) keep integration structured.

### Simple integration loop
1) Define the problem and desired outcome.  
2) List 3-5 lenses that matter (physical, human, systems, ethical, data).  
3) Borrow one question and one method from each lens.  
4) Run the smallest experiment; watch for unintended effects.  
5) Reflect and simplify-keep what works, discard the ornamental.

### Worked example
Reducing hospital wait times: physics/queuing (flow), design (wayfinding), psychology (stress reduction), economics (incentives), computing (scheduling algorithm). Combine: measure arrival patterns, redesign signage, add triage scripts, simulate schedules, and test in one wing before scaling.

## Activity
Pick a current challenge you face. List three domains that could inform it. For each, write one question that domain would ask and one method it would use. Combine the best question and method into a mini-experiment you will run this week.

## Reflection
- Which lens added the biggest insight per unit effort?
- Where did lenses conflict? How did you choose which to honor?
