# Exercises and Practice Paths

Use these as repeatable drills. Keep a log of attempts, results, and tweaks.

## Weekly polymath cycle
- Pick one intellectual skill and one embodied skill to practice.
- Run two short experiments (measure, adjust, retry) and one reflection session.
- Teach one concept you learned to a friend or online post.

## Quick drills
- Math: Do 5 minute mental-math sprints; plot a daily measurement.
- Physics: Sketch force diagrams of one household object per day.
- Writing: Freewrite 10 minutes without editing, then summarize in two sentences.
- Movement: 3 sets of balance drills (one-leg stand eyes closed) and record time.
- Craft: Fix or improve one object at home each week.

## Project templates
- Build: Make a simple Arduino/ESP32 gadget (thermometer, light meter) and document decisions.
- Observe: Keep a nature journal for 14 days noting patterns in plants, weather, or animals.
- Story: Record a 3-minute audio explaining a concept using analogy; share and collect feedback.
- Strategy: Play 10 blitz chess games; annotate two mistakes and one improvement per game.

## Reflection prompts
- What surprised me this week?
- Where did two disciplines intersect?
- What did I ignore that deserves attention?
- How did I adjust based on feedback?
