## Quick formulas
- Distance under constant acceleration: `d = v0*t + 0.5*a*t^2`
- Ohm's law: `V = I * R`
- Bayes' rule: `P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)`
- Compound interest: `A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)`

## Decision checklists
- Ethics: Who benefits? Who bears risk? What are second-order effects?
- Experiment: What is the hypothesis, variable, control, and measure of success?
